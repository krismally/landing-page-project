# landing-page-project
This is the landing page project from The Odin Project's foundations course. I used the provided design as a guideline for the general features. Then, I modified the content as well as stylistic aspects in order to get the aesthetic I wanted. I used HTML and CSS to build and style the site. Specifically, I utilized CSS's flexbox features to organize the content, stylization, and center objects vertically.
